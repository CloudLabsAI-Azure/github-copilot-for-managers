## Exercise 4: Report and Drive Adoption

### Estimated Duration: 25 Minutes

## Overview

In this exercise, you will assemble an executive-facing adoption & ROI dashboard, enrich it with cost and time-savings context, and package actionable insights for leadership. You’ll create a polished layout, add slicers for drill-down, surface savings assumptions transparently, and prepare summary artifacts that accelerate decision-making and targeted enablement.

## Objectives

You will be able to complete the following tasks:

- Task 1: Build an executive dashboard (layout, KPIs, ROI callouts, bookmarks)
- Task 2: Present findings & next steps (summary narrative, export/share, recommended actions)

## Prerequisites

- Completion of Exercises 1–3 with all core measures (Active Users, Engaged Users, Adoption Rate, Time Saved (hrs), Chat Interactions, Estimated Cost Savings if already created) available in the model.
- Power BI Desktop report open with prior visuals (line, bar, donut, table) available to copy/paste.

## Task 1: Build an Executive Dashboard



## Task 2: Present Findings & Next Steps

In this task, you will synthesize insights, generate a leadership-ready summary, and share the report and recommended action plan to drive continued adoption momentum.


## Summary

In this exercise, you consolidated adoption and productivity metrics into an executive dashboard, layered ROI estimates, and produced a narrative plus recommended actions to guide strategic Copilot rollout decisions. This completes the foundational analytics journey—future extensions can include cohort benchmarking, trend forecasting, and prompt quality analysis.
