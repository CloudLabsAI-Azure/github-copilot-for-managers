## Objective

Understand report creation and dashboard management in Power BI. By the end of this lab, you will gain insights on:

- **Create and Publish a Report:** Develop a comprehensive Power BI report, incorporating conditional formatting, custom visuals, and themes, and publish it to the Power BI Service.
- **Build and Organize a Dashboard:** Construct and organize a Power BI dashboard to effectively visualize and present data from the report.
- **Enhance Report Presentation:** Utilize features such as custom logos, conditional formatting, and bookmarks to create an engaging and informative report narrative.

## Pre-requisites

- Basic Knowledge of Power BI
- Access to Power BI Desktop and Service
- Understanding of Report Design Principles

## Architecture

In this lab, you'll start with a pre-created Power BI report and follow a structured process to enhance and publish it. Initially, you will apply conditional formatting to highlight important data points within the report. Next, you'll add logos to the visuals and filters to incorporate branding elements. After that, you'll import and integrate custom visuals to enrich the data representation. You will then apply a custom theme to ensure the report aligns with specific design guidelines. To enhance storytelling, you'll use bookmarks to create a narrative flow within the report. Finally, you'll publish the completed report to the Power BI Service for sharing and collaboration. Detailed instructions and visual aids will guide you through each step, ensuring you gain practical experience with Power BI's features.
