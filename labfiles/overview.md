# Measuring GitHub Copilot Impact for Managers

### Estimated Duration: 1 Hour

## Overview

In this comprehensive lab series, you'll master the essential skills needed to measure, analyze, and communicate the business value of GitHub Copilot across your development organization. You will begin by learning how to enable and access GitHub Copilot usage reports, understanding the rich analytics possibilities when AI-assisted development data is combined with organizational context. The lab then guides you through transforming raw usage data into meaningful management insights using Power BI, creating strategic measures that reveal adoption patterns, user engagement levels, and team performance across different technologies and roles. You'll discover how to measure concrete productivity improvements by analyzing pull request metrics before and after Copilot adoption, quantifying lead time reductions, cycle time improvements, and throughput increases that directly impact delivery velocity. Finally, you'll build executive-ready dashboards that combine adoption metrics with productivity gains to calculate return on investment (ROI), creating compelling visualizations that demonstrate clear business value and support data-driven decisions about Copilot program expansion and optimization. By the end of this hands-on journey, you'll have the complete toolkit needed to establish comprehensive Copilot analytics programs that transform usage data into actionable business intelligence for strategic decision-making.

## Objective

By the end of this lab, you will be able to:

- **Enable and Access Usage Reports**: Navigate GitHub Copilot administrative settings to activate reporting features and download comprehensive organization-level usage data that provides crucial insights into adoption patterns, user engagement, and technology preferences across development teams.

- **Analyze Adoption and Engagement**: Transform raw Copilot usage data into strategic management insights using Power BI, creating sophisticated measures that identify high-performing teams, understand technology adoption patterns, and spot areas requiring additional support or training interventions.

- **Measure Productivity Impact**: Import and analyze pull request metrics from before and after Copilot adoption to quantify concrete productivity improvements, measuring lead time reductions, cycle time improvements, and throughput increases that demonstrate tangible business value.

- **Calculate ROI and Build Executive Dashboards**: Create comprehensive executive-ready dashboards that combine adoption metrics with productivity improvements to calculate return on investment, establishing compelling visualizations that communicate clear business value and support strategic decision-making about Copilot program optimization.

- **Establish Data-Driven Management Practices**: Implement systematic approaches to Copilot program measurement that enable ongoing optimization, team performance comparison, and evidence-based decisions about training, tooling, and resource allocation across your development organization.

- **Communicate Business Value**: Develop executive presentation capabilities using interactive dashboards and compelling metrics that translate technical improvements into business-relevant insights, supporting budget justification and program expansion initiatives.

## Prerequisites

Participants should have:

- **GitHub Organization Owner** permissions to access Copilot usage reports and administrative settings.
- **GitHub Copilot Business or Enterprise** licensing activated for your organization.
- **Power BI Desktop** installed and access to Power BI Service for dashboard publishing and sharing.
- **Basic understanding** of software development metrics such as pull request workflows, lead time, cycle time, and development team structures.
- **Familiarity with business analytics concepts** including ROI calculations, productivity measurement, and executive reporting requirements.
- **Access to organizational context data** or understanding of how to enrich GitHub Copilot usage data with team assignments, role definitions, and technology stack information.
- **Email access** to the GitHub organization owner mailbox for report notification receipt.
- **Management perspective** on software development operations and experience with team performance evaluation and optimization initiatives.

## Explanation of Components

- **GitHub Copilot Usage Reports**: GitHub's Activity reports provide comprehensive per-user metrics including code suggestions, acceptances, chat interactions, and technology preferences, serving as the foundational data source for all analytics and enabling managers to understand adoption patterns and user engagement across their development teams.

- **Power BI Desktop & Service**: Microsoft Power BI is a comprehensive business analytics platform that enables data connection, transformation, and visualization capabilities, providing the primary toolset for creating interactive dashboards, calculating strategic measures, and publishing executive-ready reports that communicate Copilot's business value.

- **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)**: DAX is Power BI's formula language used to create calculated measures and columns, enabling sophisticated analytics calculations such as adoption rates, productivity improvements, ROI calculations, and dynamic filtering that transform raw usage data into meaningful management insights.

- **Pull Request Metrics**: Development productivity indicators including lead time (total delivery duration), cycle time (active development time), and throughput (PR completion rates) that provide objective measures of team performance and enable before-and-after comparisons to quantify Copilot's productivity impact.

- **ROI Analysis Framework**: A systematic approach to calculating return on investment that translates productivity improvements into financial value, incorporating time savings calculations, cost-benefit analysis, and payback period determination to demonstrate clear business justification for Copilot investment.

- **Executive Dashboard Design**: Strategic visualization techniques focused on communicating key performance indicators, trend analysis, and actionable insights to executive stakeholders, emphasizing clear value propositions, comparative metrics, and decision-support information rather than technical implementation details.
