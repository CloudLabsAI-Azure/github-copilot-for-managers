# Measuring GitHub Copilot Impact for Managers

### Overall Estimated Duration: 1 Hour

## Overview

In this comprehensive lab series, you will master the essential skills needed to measure, analyze, and communicate the business value of **GitHub Copilot** across your development organization. Starting with enabling GitHub Copilot usage reports, you'll learn to access comprehensive organization-level data that reveals adoption patterns and user engagement. You'll then transform raw usage data into strategic management insights using Power BI, creating sophisticated measures that identify high-performing teams and technology preferences. Next, you'll measure concrete productivity improvements by analyzing pull request metrics before and after Copilot adoption, quantifying lead time reductions and throughput increases. Finally, you'll build executive-ready dashboards that calculate ROI and demonstrate clear business value through compelling visualizations. Step-by-step instructions with screenshots guide you throughout this data-driven journey.
