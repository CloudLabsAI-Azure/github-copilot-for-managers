## Risk Mitigation

### Potential Challenges
1. **Sales team unfamiliar with Power BI**
   - *Mitigation*: Provide simplified templates, focus on interpretation over building
   
2. **Sales team uncomfortable with coding (Exercise 2)**
   - *Mitigation*: Use simple, business-relevant scenarios; heavy commenting; celebrate "I'm not a developer" positioning
   
3. **Resistance to technical lab from pure sales roles**
   - *Mitigation*: Emphasize customer-facing outcomes, minimize technical jargon; Exercise 2 builds selling confidence
   
4. **Content becomes too sales-y, loses technical credibility**
   - *Mitigation*: Balance with actual data and realistic scenarios
   
5. **Time constraint too aggressive with new exercise**
   - *Mitigation*: Provide optional "deep dive" sections for interested learners; fast-track path available
   
6. **Copilot licensing/access issues for participants**
   - *Mitigation*: Pre-provision licenses; have fallback recorded demos

### Quality Assurance
- Test with non-technical sales personnel
- Test Exercise 2 with people who've never coded
- Validate timing with diverse skill levels
- Ensure all competitive claims are factual and defensible
- Review with legal/compliance for any sensitive positioning
- Verify Copilot demos are reliable and reproducible

## Appendix: Sample Content Transformations

### Example 1: Exercise 2 Introduction (NEW EXERCISE)

**Sales-focused approach:**
> "In this exercise, you'll use GitHub Copilot yourself to build real business tools. This hands-on experience is crucial—customers can tell when you've actually used the product versus just presenting slides. You'll discover 'aha moments' you can share authentically in sales conversations, and you'll gain the confidence to handle live demo requests. By the end, you'll have personal stories that resonate: 'When I first tried Copilot, I was skeptical too, but then...'"

### Example 2: Exercise 3 Introduction

**BEFORE (Manager-focused):**
> "In this exercise, you will load the Copilot organization usage data into Power BI and create essential measures to understand adoption patterns, user engagement levels, and team performance."

**AFTER (Sales-focused):**
> "In this exercise, you'll learn how to build a compelling adoption story for your customers using real Copilot usage data. You'll identify success patterns, quantify engagement levels, and create visuals that prove business value—essential skills for winning deals and accelerating POC approvals. Now that you've experienced Copilot yourself in Exercise 2, you can speak authentically about what these metrics mean for developers."

### Example 3: Measure Creation Context

**BEFORE (Manager-focused):**
> "**Manager Insight:** Acceptance rate indicates how relevant Copilot suggestions are. Higher rates (>50%) typically indicate better user adoption and tool effectiveness."

**AFTER (Sales-focused):**
> "**Sales Tip:** When presenting acceptance rates to customers, position 50%+ as 'industry-leading AI assistance accuracy.' Use this to counter objections about code quality and developer trust. If showing lower rates, frame as 'opportunity for developer training' rather than tool limitation. **Pro Tip**: Reference your own Exercise 2 experience—'When I used Copilot, I accepted about X% of suggestions because...'"

### Example 4: Visualization Purpose

**BEFORE (Manager-focused):**
> "**Manager Value:** This table shows which teams are adopting Copilot most effectively and where you might need additional training or support."

**AFTER (Sales-focused):**
> "**Customer Story:** Use this team comparison to show prospects how different departments can achieve varying success levels—creating an opportunity for professional services, training packages, and phased rollout strategies. High-performing teams become your proof points; lower-performing teams justify additional services revenue. **Remember your Exercise 2 experience**: You went from zero to productive in 12 minutes—that's the transformation customers want."

3. ✅ **Equips** them with customer-ready assets and narratives  
4. ✅ **Accelerates** deal cycles through data-driven conversations
5. ✅ **Differentiates** GitHub Copilot from competitors
6. ✅ **Increases** win rates through better business case articulation
7. ✅ **Builds** authentic confidence through personal "aha moments"

**Estimated Total Implementation Time**: 2-3 weeks  
**Recommended Team**: 1 content writer, 1 sales enablement specialist, 1 technical reviewer, 1 designer (for visuals)

**Critical Success Factor**: Exercise 2 must be accessible yet impressive. Balance simplicity (so everyone succeeds) with "wow factor" (so everyone is excited to demo to customers).
